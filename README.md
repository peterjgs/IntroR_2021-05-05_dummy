### Resources

#### tidyverse

Lots more about the `tidyverse` is available in the free online [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} textbook by Hadley Wickham.


#### dplyr

`dplyr` has heaps more functionality than what we've covered. Two other major things that can be done with `dplyr` are

- [Reshaping data](https://cengel.github.io/R-data-wrangling/tidyr.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Combining datasets](https://rpubs.com/williamsurles/293454){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

A good place to find out more about `dplyr` is the [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

#### ggplot2

We have covered the basic functionality of `ggplot2`, but there are lots of bells and whistles available. A good place to find out more about it is the [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Also, have a look at the extensive [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for code for every possible plot you can imagine. There's also a [book](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} by Hadley Wickham about `ggplot2` for when you really want to delve deeper into the package.
